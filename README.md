Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Emre from Turkey, currently residing and working in Slovenia as a researcher at the University of Maribor, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering. Concurrently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. In the initial phase of my career, I served as a precision mechanical design engineer.

During my master's studies, I focused on the construction of a high-precision Additive Manufacturing Machine, showcasing my dedication to pushing the boundaries of engineering. My passion lies in the  design and construction of electro-mechanical systems.

Presently, my expertise has evolved towards material characterization. I am deeply involved in the design and characterization of metamaterials, specifically tailored for applications in crash shock absorbance. To facilitate their parametric design, I have developed Python codes for:

-Parametric Design of TPMS structures
-G code generation for scaffold structures

In the realm of experimental characterization, I have engineered the following codes. While computer vision-based algorithms can find application in various contexts, my specific focus has been on the Direct Impact Hopkinson Bar, where a 2-measuring point wave separation algorithm is employed:

-2D Digital Image Correlation algorithm
-2 Measuring point wave separation algorithm for DIHB
